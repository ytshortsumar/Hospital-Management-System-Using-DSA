# Reflection

## Umar Farooq
I worked mostly on implementing the main program and improving logic. I learned how linked lists work in real projects. If I had one more week, I would add file saving/loading.

## Soban Rasheed
I worked on documentation, testing and improving code readability. I learned GitHub collaboration. With more time, I would improve searching and add a simple UI.
