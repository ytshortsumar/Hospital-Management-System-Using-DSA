Welcome to the Hospital Universe! 
I, Umar the Doubly Linked List, connect all the beds forward and backward for easy management. 
I, Soban the Queue, line up patients in order so no one waits too long for a bed. 
Patients arrive with different diseases and ages, and we track them carefully. 
Beds are assigned automatically using the Queue system. 
Discharges are managed efficiently to free up space for new patients. 
Our system keeps statistics on occupied and available beds. 
Together, we ensure smooth hospital management using our data structure powers.
